# Introduction to Data Structures
## Author: Rohan Singh
This repository holds source code for the implementation of most of the Data Structures that are taught in college. It also contains various algorithms and uses of these Data Structures. There are folders for each of the types of Data Strucutures and relevant algorithms, you can check them out if you just want to look at one of them. This repository can also be used for refreshing DSA concepts for technical interviews.  

At the moment most of the source code is in Java, for source code in Python, please check the Python_Src folder.  

These are some of the things that are inside this directory:  
  - Arrays:
    - This contains a single class that has a Array-based implementaion of a List. 
  - LinkedList:
    - This contains a single class for a singly-linked list with basic add/remove features as well as O(n) reverse.
  - Stacks and Queues:
    - Circular Array implementation of Queues  
    - LinkedList implementation of Queues
    - Array implementation of Stacks
    - LinkedList implementation of Stacks
    - Stack using Queue
    - Queue using Stack
    - Demo files for these classes
  - Trees (Binary Search Trees):
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree equipped with search, delete and insert.
  - Priority Queues and Heaps
  - HashTables:
    - Array based implementation of a HashTable.
    - Additional wordCount method, to count the occurences of unique words in a given sentence.
  - Sorting Algorithms:
    - Selection Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Shell Sort
    - QuickSort
    - MergeSort
  - Graphs:
    - Implementation of Graph ADT
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Prim's Algorithm
    - Note: this is also implemented in Python
