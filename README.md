# Introduction to Data Structures
## Author: Rohan Singh
This repository holds source code for the implementation of most of the Data Structures that are taught in college. It also contains various algorithms and uses of these Data Structures. There are folders for each of the types of Data Strucutures and relevant algorithms, you can check them out if you just want to look at one of them.

At the moment most of the source code is in Java, for source code in Python, please check the Python_Src folder.  

These are some of the things that are inside this directory:  
  - Arrays and ArrayLists
  - LinkedLists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees (Binary Search Trees)
  - Priority Queues and Heaps
  - HashTables
  - Sorting Algorithms
  - Graphs
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Prim's Algorithm
